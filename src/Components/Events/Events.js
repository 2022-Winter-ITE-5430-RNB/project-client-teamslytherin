  <h1> Meet our Pets at a virtual adoption event</h1>
  
    
  <p>  The best way to meet our Pets is to attend our monthly adoption events. Our
        upcoming schedule is located below. You can also subscribe to our public 
        google calendar as well to easily access all our upcoming events. All dog 
        and/or cat adoption events appear in the blue boxes below.
       <br /><br />
      If you are planning to adopt at an event, you can start the process in advance 
      or on site. To start in advance, fill out an application form and follow the instructions
       on the form to submit. Someone from our team will then get you started on our adoption 
       process! You can also bring your application to the event or fill one out onsite, 
       but (1) if you have current or past pets, please bring their vet records and (2) if 
       you are renting, please bring proof you can have pets as well as documentation that 
       the specific pet you're interested in will be permitted. We post the dogs and cats 
       attending our events on Facebook at 6pm the day before, but because these lists are
        subject to change, it is always best to confirm an animal's attendance and event
         adoption status with their adoption coordinator (email listed in their bio).
